# 16. Use Token-based Authentication

Date: 2024-02-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The "Coffeehouse" project is an online service allowing customers to order coffeehouse products from a variety of digital devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops. As part of providing a secure and efficient user authentication mechanism, we need to decide between using traditional HTTP sessions and token-based authentication. This decision is crucial for ensuring a seamless, secure user experience across different devices and platforms.

### Possible Solutions

#### 1. HTTP Sessions
- Pros:
  - Simplicity: Straightforward to implement using conventional web application frameworks.
  - Familiarity: Well-understood by developers due to its long history of use in web applications.
- Cons:
  - Scalability: Session data is stored server-side, which can lead to scalability issues as user base and session data grow.
  - Device Compatibility: HTTP sessions, typically managed with cookies, may not be the best fit for non-web clients like mobile apps.
  - Portability: Sessions are tightly coupled to the server, making it difficult to maintain session continuity across different services or domains.

#### 2. Token-Based Authentication
- Pros:
  - Scalability: Tokens are stored client-side, reducing the server load and making the system more scalable.
  - Flexibility and Portability: Ideal for distributed systems and services accessed by various client types, including web applications, mobile devices, and other internet-connected devices.
  - Statelessness: Each request contains all the necessary information to authenticate it, making the system more resilient and easier to scale.
- Cons:
  - Security Considerations: Tokens, if intercepted, could be used by unauthorized parties. Proper security measures like HTTPS, token expiration, and refresh mechanisms are essential.
  - Complexity: Implementing token-based authentication requires a good understanding of security practices and additional considerations for token management and refresh strategies.

## Decision

After evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of both HTTP sessions and token-based authentication, we have decided to adopt token-based authentication for the "Coffeehouse" project.

Reasoning for the Decision
- Cross-Device Compatibility: Our system must support a wide variety of devices and platforms. Token-based authentication provides a more flexible and universally applicable solution compared to cookie-based HTTP sessions.
- Scalability: Token-based authentication aligns with our scalability goals by reducing server load. Tokens are stored and managed client-side, thereby decreasing the need for server-side session storage.
- Statelessness and Decoupling: Adopting a stateless authentication mechanism allows our services to be more resilient and easier to scale. It supports our architectural direction towards microservices by ensuring that authentication can be consistently applied across different services without maintaining session states.
- Security and Portability: While both approaches require secure transmission (e.g., via HTTPS), token-based authentication offers better control over token lifecycle, including expiration and revocation. This enhances security and provides a more robust framework for managing user sessions across different devices and services.

## Consequences

- Implementation of Security Best Practices: We must ensure the secure handling of tokens, including secure transmission, storage, and the implementation of token expiration and refresh tokens.
- Increased Complexity for Token Management: The system will require mechanisms to issue, renew, and validate tokens securely. This includes handling token expiration and potentially implementing a secure refresh token mechanism.
- Client-Side Storage and Management: Clients will be responsible for storing and managing authentication tokens. We will need to provide clear guidelines and best practices for clients to securely handle tokens.
